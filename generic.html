        <p> I graduated in 2022 from the University of Wyoming with a 3.4 GPA and a degree concentrated in Big Data. I majored in Computer Science, and minored in Statistics. I am heavily focused on the beauty of data, and I also come with a suite of software development skills. A jack of all trades, but I am NOT a master of none. My two favorite classes in college were Multivariate Analysis (A statistical techniques course), and Machine Learning. After graduating, I landed my first job at one of the top tech consulting firms in the world, Sogeti (part of Capgemini). While I worked there I worked briefly on Identity and Access Management Operations and Data Management. I also had a role serving as a Liaison between the Business Ruless, Manual Testing, and Automation teams at Humana Health Insurance. I was even specifically nominated to represent Sogeti in a Google GenAI Hackathon (which you can find out more about in the Projects & Contact tab of this portfolio site). In addition I also have a wealth of IT support experience (6+ years) and greatly enjoy troubleshooting, teamwork, leadership, and customer service excellence. I am proficient with administrating all Operating Systems, Computer Networking, Audio/Visual support, imaging, and more!  </p>

        <p> In my free time I enjoy hiking, camping, backpacking and mountaineering, as well as snowboarding during the winter. I love playing the acoustic and electric guitar, and writing music. I am constantly trying to immerse myself in new subjects and absorb as much knowledge as I can. You can definitely catch me googling peer-reviewed research studies on my day off. I am a deep philosopher and one of the philosophies I subscribe to is, "Work hard. Play hard." I'm also a big horror film buff.</p>
