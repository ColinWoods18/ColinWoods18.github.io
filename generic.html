        <p> I qraduated in 2022 from the University of Wyoming with a 3.4 GPA and a degree concentrated in Big Data. For this degree, I Majored in Computer Science, and Minored in Statistics. I am a data focused software developer. A jack of all trades. My two favorite classes in college were Multivariate Analysis (A statistical techniques course), and Machine Learning. After graduating, I landed my first job at one of the top tech consulting firms in the world, Sogeti (part of Capgemini). There I worked briefly on Identity and Access Management Operations and Data Management. I also had a role as a Business Rules, Manual Testing, and Automation Liaison, and even was specifically nominated to represent Sogeti in a Google GenAI Hackathon. </p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy hiking, camping, backpacking and mountaineering, as well as snowboarding during the winter. I'm also a horror film buff, I love playing the acoustic and electric guitar, and writing music</p>
