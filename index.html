								<h3>Google GenAI Hackathon</h3>

							</div>
							<p>I was personally nominated to represent Sogeti in the Google GenAI Hackathon. Our team was tasked with creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a business application utilizing GCP's GenAI services. Our team created a personalized FoodQuest app which would find food options for users using their location. It was able to adjust for health conditions or allergies, or even different dietary restricitions or needs. For example you could ask it for food options near you that are under 400 calories and it would provide a list of dishes at different restaurants that met the requirement. We used a webapp frontend plugged into a Python based backend hosted on Google App Engine, and communicated with Google's VertexAI chatbot model via their PaLM2 API.</p>

								<h3>OpenCV Puzzle Solver</h3>

							</div>
							<p>For my senior design project, our team created a puzzle solver app where th user can upload photos of the puzzle pieces of a puzzle they would like to be automatically solved. Then using OpenCV computer vision, we scanned each piece and defined the size and length of the piece and edges. Once we had all of the dimensions, we used a genetic algorithm to progressively solve the puzzle. We were able to complete large puzzles of up to 4000 pieces without error, depending on the color profile of the puzzle itself.</p>

                            </div>
							<p>Of the courses that I took during my Bachelor's degree. One of the most difficult classes was my Linux Programming course. In this class I did everything from creating recreating command line utilities from scratch, creating my own Makefiles as well as my own version of the Tape Archive. I also created socket communication, shell scripts, and my own version of the linux shell itself.</p>

									<h3>Stenography Project</h3>
								</header>
								</div>
							<p>Another partner and I developed a system for hiding copyright information within artwork images, using Stenography to insert the copyright information via small shifts in RGB color values in the image. The result is a visually unaltered and unnoticable copyright that can be traced back to the original creator!</p>
